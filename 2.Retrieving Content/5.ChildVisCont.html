    <h1>Using Child and Content Filters</h1>
    <p>These selectors are used to retrieve content that matches certain conditions, such as whether they contain certain content, whether they are visible/hidden, or whether they are in a certain position within their parent.</p>
	<ul id="list1">
		<li class="a"><code>:contains('<i>text</i>')</code>: select elements that contain specific text</li>
		<li class="a"><code>:parent</code>: select elements have at least one child node (element or text)</li>
		<li class="a"><code>:has(<i>selector</i>)</code>: select elements that contain at least one element that matches the selector</li>
		<li class="a"><code>:first-child</code>: select elements that are the first child of their parents</li>
		<li class="a"><code>:last-of-type</code>: select elements that are the last of their type among siblings</li>
		<li class="a"><code>:nth-child()</code>: select elements that are the nth child of their parent</li>
	</ul>
